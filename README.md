# TigerWoods-AdminZone


This script is made to help admins handle player reports without disrupting active RP scenes.

When a player makes a report, the admin can safely bring (teleport) that player to a designated admin zone. 
This prevents any RP interruptions and avoids situations where players could abuse the teleport to RDM, VDM, or pull out weapons while being handled by staff.
